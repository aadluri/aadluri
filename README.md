# About Me


Hi! I'm Archita, a computational chemist transitioning into the world of data engineering. I have a background in Computational Chemistry (statstical modeling, electronic structure calcs, ab initio and molecular dynamics and CPMD  simulations of molecules and solids esp semicnoductors)  high-performance computing (HPC), Python and Bash/UNIX, I'm now diving into tools like Mahcine learning algorithms, Apache Spark and Hadoop & SQL to build scalable and efficient data solutions. I'm trying to leveraging my expeience with big data and materials science to solve real-world problems.

## Academic Projects

1. **(Paper):** [Tuning the Dielectric Response in a Nanocomposite Material through Nanoparticle Morphology](https://doi.org/10.1039/D1RA07472E)
   Raw Data and some scripts for [QuantumEspresso Inputs](https://github.com/Paci-Group/Dielectric-Nanocomposite-QE)
   Used the [PyBec Package](https://github.com/brettrhenderson/pybec) from fellow research group member Brett Henderson
   - Technologies: HPC computing - QuantumEspresso, Siesta, Python for Data Visualization
   - Goal: Build a method for computing static dieletcric constant for trapped molecular nanoparticles in a dielectric solid.

2. **Project:** Optical Dieletric in Polymer and Effects of Polydispersity of Interacting Metal Inclusions (to be published)
   Postprocessing of data to visualize bandgap engineering effects of these simulations. [Notebook Here](https://github.com/aadluri/PostProc_MaterialsModeling)
   Please contact me if you wish to use or have any questions. All data produced using SIESTA compiled from docker image. 
   - Technologies: Statictical methods, Molecular dynamics - Siesta, ASE, Python for Data Visualization
   - Goal: Examine the effects of interacting molecular metal nanoparticles on dielectric function with repsect to induced fields within polymer.
