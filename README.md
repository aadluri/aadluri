Hi! I'm Archita, a computational chemist transitioning into the world of data engineering. I have a background in Computational Chemistry (statstical modeling, electronic structure calcs, ab initio and molecular dynamics and CPMD  simulations of molecules and solids esp semicnoductors)  high-performance computing (HPC), Python and Bash/UNIX, I'm now diving into tools like Mahcine learning algorithms, Apache Spark and Hadoop & SQL to build scalable and efficient data solutions. I'm trying to leverage my expeience with big data and materials science to transition fields.

## Academic Projects
1. **(Paper):** [Tuning the Dielectric Response in a Nanocomposite Material through Nanoparticle Morphology](https://doi.org/10.1039/D1RA07472E)
   Raw Data and some scripts for [QuantumEspresso Inputs](https://github.com/Paci-Group/Dielectric-Nanocomposite-QE) 
   Used the [PyBec Package](https://github.com/brettrhenderson/pybec) from fellow research group member Brett Henderson
   - Technologies: HPC computing - QuantumEspresso, Siesta, Python for Data Visualization
   - Goal: Build a method for computing static dieletcric constant for trapped molecular nanoparticles in a dielectric solid.
3. **Project:** Optical Dieletric in Polymer and Effects of Polydispersity of Interacting Metal Inclusions (to be published)
   Postprocessing of data to visualize bandgap engineering effects of these simulations. [Notebook Here](https://github.com/aadluri/PostProc_MaterialsModeling)
   - Technologies: Statictical methods, Molecular dynamics - Siesta, ASE, Python for Data Visualization
   - Goal: Examine the effects of interacting molecular metal nanoparticles on dielectric function with repsect to induced fields within polymer.

## Data Analytics Projects - Still a work in progress. 
Trying to display my skills by building smaller projects. 
1. ** Food Pricing Volatility Project** Made with Carl Mcgarry, this is a large project that downloads Statscan data, filters/formats the data into several tables (bridge, data, geo) for PowerBI reporting. there is also a volatility model (random forest plus various hyperparameter tuning) and a streamlit app for both viewing the data and predicting volatility. Currently only the 3 month-over month forecats is accurate, the 3-year window needs some finetuning. The aim was to create a tool that nonprofits and food advocacy groups can use in their data analysis.
2. 
3. ** Trendalyzer **  - analyzing colour and sentiment from reddit homedecor subreddits. Working towards creating a prototype that creates dashboards, then will try to expand into a general use case that analyzes any style, fashion or decor subreddit for colour and text trends.
